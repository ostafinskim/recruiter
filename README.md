## Project Overview

Recruiter is a job tracking app that helps you keep track of the jobs you have applied for, the interview requests you have received, and the rejections. It also has a stats section that shows a chart of how many applications you sent each month for the last six months to monitor your consistency.

Next.js is used for this project because it makes it easier to develop full-stack applications. It allows both frontend and backend code to be in one place, which simplifies the development process and reduces the need to switch contexts. Next.js also offers powerful features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and API routes.
